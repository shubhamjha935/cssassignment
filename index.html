      <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li>
      <li>
        CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or
        in the media.
      </li>
      <li>
       <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> CSS is not necessary</span> <span style="background-color: yellow;"> CSS saves a lot of work</span>. It can contol the layout
        of multiple web pages all at once
      </li>
      <li><a href="">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 style="color:red;">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul style="color: brown;">
      <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
      <li>Internal- by using a style element in the head section</li>
      <li>External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
      <li>
        The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS
        files. however, <span style="background-color: yellow;">in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal
        styles</span>, because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try
        it yourself
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one
      unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to
      link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.
    </p>
    <p style="color:brown;">
      There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used
      are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should
      be applie
